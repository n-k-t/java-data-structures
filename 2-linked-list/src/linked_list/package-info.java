 * There are two classes within this package to make a linked list from scratch. There are already linked lists
 * within Java, this is just demonstrating how to create a basic single linked list. First, the node which holds
 * some data as well as a memory location. Second, the linked list itself which essentially stitches the nodes 
 * together. It is a long string of nodes where the head is the only stored and you must traverse down the path
 * in order to reach other nodes. Each node is connected as the location of the next node in memory is stored
 * with the previous node.
